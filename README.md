# Bioeconomy

1. Optimizing Supply Chain Networks for Sustainable Bioeconomy: This thesis could focus on designing and optimizing supply chain networks for the production, processing, and distribution of bio-based products. It could include considerations for environmental impact, resource efficiency, and economic viability.
2. Decision Support Systems for Biomass Feedstock Selection and Allocation: Develop models and algorithms to assist in the selection and allocation of biomass feedstocks for bioenergy and bioproducts. This could involve factors like transportation costs, feedstock availability, and environmental impacts.
3. Multi-objective Optimization of Bioenergy Production Systems: Investigate the trade-offs between economic, environmental, and social objectives in the design and operation of bioenergy production systems. This could involve techniques like multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.
4. Risk Assessment and Management in Bioeconomy Ventures: Explore methods for assessing and mitigating risks associated with bioeconomy projects, including those related to market volatility, regulatory compliance, and resource availability.
5. Integration of Circular Economy Principles in Bio-based Industries: Study how circular economy principles can be applied to bio-based industries to enhance resource efficiency, reduce waste, and create sustainable value chains.
6. Dynamic Resource Allocation for Bioeconomy Investments: Develop models and algorithms for dynamically allocating resources (e.g., capital, labour, biomass) in bioeconomy ventures to adapt to changing market conditions and technological advancements.
7. Carbon Footprint Minimization in Bio-based Value Chains: Investigate strategies for minimizing the carbon footprint of bio-based value chains, considering factors like transportation emissions, energy consumption, and land-use impacts.
8. Optimal Siting and Sizing of Bioenergy Facilities: Use operations research techniques to determine the optimal locations and sizes of bioenergy facilities, considering factors such as feedstock availability, energy demand, and environmental impact.
9. Life Cycle Assessment and Optimization of Bio-based Products: Combine life cycle assessment (LCA) with optimization methods to evaluate and improve the environmental performance of bio-based products, from raw material extraction to end-of-life.
10. Resilience Analysis of Bioeconomy Systems to External Shocks: Assess the resilience of bioeconomy systems to various types of external shocks (e.g., natural disasters, policy changes) and develop strategies to enhance their adaptive capacity.
