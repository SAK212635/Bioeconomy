# Bioeconomy

- Optimizing Supply Chain Networks for Sustainable Bioeconomy: This thesis could focus on designing and optimizing supply chain networks for the production, processing, and distribution of bio-based products. It could include considerations for environmental impact, resource efficiency, and economic viability.
- Decision Support Systems for Biomass Feedstock Selection and Allocation: Develop models and algorithms to assist in the selection and allocation of biomass feedstocks for bioenergy and bioproducts. This could involve factors like transportation costs, feedstock availability, and environmental impacts.
- Multi-objective Optimization of Bioenergy Production Systems: Investigate the trade-offs between economic, environmental, and social objectives in the design and operation of bioenergy production systems. This could involve techniques like multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.
- Risk Assessment and Management in Bioeconomy Ventures: Explore methods for assessing and mitigating risks associated with bioeconomy projects, including those related to market volatility, regulatory compliance, and resource availability.
- Integration of Circular Economy Principles in Bio-based Industries: Study how circular economy principles can be applied to bio-based industries to enhance resource efficiency, reduce waste, and create sustainable value chains.
- Dynamic Resource Allocation for Bioeconomy Investments: Develop models and algorithms for dynamically allocating resources (e.g., capital, labour, biomass) in bioeconomy ventures to adapt to changing market conditions and technological advancements.
- Carbon Footprint Minimization in Bio-based Value Chains: Investigate strategies for minimizing the carbon footprint of bio-based value chains, considering factors like transportation emissions, energy consumption, and land-use impacts.
- Optimal Siting and Sizing of Bioenergy Facilities: Use operations research techniques to determine the optimal locations and sizes of bioenergy facilities, considering factors such as feedstock availability, energy demand, and environmental impact.
- Life Cycle Assessment and Optimization of Bio-based Products: Combine life cycle assessment (LCA) with optimization methods to evaluate and improve the environmental performance of bio-based products, from raw material extraction to end-of-life.
- Resilience Analysis of Bioeconomy Systems to External Shocks: Assess the resilience of bioeconomy systems to various types of external shocks (e.g., natural disasters, policy changes) and develop strategies to enhance their adaptive capacity.
